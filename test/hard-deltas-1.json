Rafael Reif.</em></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To the members of the MIT community,<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nThis evening, a few blocks from our campus, MIT will launch something new: an accelerator specially geared to serve new ventures based on cutting-edge science and technology. It will supply the particular combination of resources they need to develop and bring to market innovations that address society's most important challenges. We're calling it The Engine.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\n<strong>Why is MIT launching The Engine?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We designed The Engine in response to a frustration we heard repeatedly from faculty, student and alumni entrepreneurs as well as corporate leaders: that while venture capital (VC) funding works beautifully for start-ups that can reach market profitability, IPO or buyout in three to five years, it is not as well geared to support breakthrough technologies built on new science and engineering, which typically take more time.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nToday, innovators in fields like energy, manufacturing, robotics, biotech and medical devices often find it extremely difficult to secure the sustained funding, space, equipment, expertise and networks to fully develop their technologies; this struggle itself can needlessly prolong the development process, stretching it to a decade or more. All too often, \\\"tough-tech\\\" entrepreneurs never find sufficient support, which discourages others from trying, a dynamic that leaves many promising ideas stranded in the lab.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nMIT's mission statement directs us not only to \\\"advance knowledge\\\" and \\\"educate students,\\\" but also to bring \\\"knowledge to bear on the world's great challenges.\\\" If we hope to deliver serious technological solutions to urgent global challenges — like clean water, climate change, sustainable energy, cancer, Alzheimer's, infectious disease, and more — we need to make sure the innovators working on those problems see a realistic pathway to the marketplace. The Engine can provide that pathway by prioritizing breakthrough ideas over early profit, helping to shorten the time it takes these ventures to become \\\"VC-ready,\\\" providing local space and comprehensive support in the meantime, and creating an enthusiastic community of inventors and supporters focused on delivering new science-based innovation to make a better world.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nAs I write in this Boston Globe <a href=\\\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/10/26/reif/o0I3OhgX8B1HYjYi04PzJL/story.html\\\">op-ed</a>, I am convinced that by adding this vital new resource to the Greater Boston ecosystem, we can empower its innovators and catalyze its growth.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nYou can read more about the concept <a href=\\\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/mit-announces-the-engine-for-entrepreneurs-1026\\\">here</a>.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\n<strong>How will it work?</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Structurally, The Engine will be a separate entity, giving it the freedom to work with innovators from inside and outside MIT whose technologies hold the greatest promise for solving important societal problems.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nIf you have questions — from how The Engine will operate, to how you and your company might get involved — I encourage you to consult The Engine's <a href=\\\"http://www.engine.xyz\\\">website</a>, which will be updated regularly with further details. We will also hold a community forum on November 30th, with time and place to be announced via MIT News.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\n<strong>A natural next step</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Of course, The Engine is only the latest step in MIT's longstanding drive to make our campus the most stimulating and supportive academic environment in the world for innovation. Over decades — and now with the leadership of the <a href=\\\"https://innovation.mit.edu/\\\">MIT Innovation Initiative</a> and the <a href=\\\"http://entrepreneurship.mit.edu/\\\">Martin Trust Center</a> for MIT Entrepreneurship — the Institute has worked with growing intensity to establish and enhance an array of resources to help MIT makers, inventors and entrepreneurs get their best ideas off the ground, here on campus. One look at this <a href=\\\"https://innovation.mit.edu/resources/\\\">remarkable roster</a> of centers, programs, hackathons, seed funds, contests, clubs and curricula gives a vivid impression of the depth and breadth of these efforts to inspire and cultivate our home-grown entrepreneurs.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nWhat's more, as we pioneer the new field of innovation science, which studies the underlying dynamics of innovation itself, MIT is investing extensively in the infrastructure of innovation, from our growing network of maker spaces to the redevelopment of Kendall Square. Our efforts extend well beyond Cambridge, as well, from MIT's leading role in the national Advanced Manufacturing Partnership, to the work of MITx to train aspiring entrepreneurs around the world. And of course, inspiring every one of these efforts is the example of our graduates, through the more than 30,000 active firms founded by living MIT entrepreneurs.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nBuilding on this deep entrepreneurial legacy, The Engine is a natural, complementary next step, one that aims to strengthen the MIT community, our Cambridge neighborhood and our regional innovation ecosystem, and to enhance its impact and influence on the nation and the world.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\n<strong>With thanks</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine came to life through the leadership of Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz, who drew on his deep grasp of the regional innovation ecosystem and his relationships with its entrepreneurial leaders to pioneer this important new idea. In this effort, he worked closely with Provost Marty Schmidt, who brought invaluable expertise from his work inside multiple tough-tech start-ups, and EECS Department Head Anantha Chandrakasan, an inspiring thought-partner who also helped build crucial support.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nThis effort also benefited from the insights, ideas and hard work of many creative thinkers and doers inside and outside MIT. On behalf of the MIT community, I express our gratitude to everyone involved.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nI believe The Engine can make a decisive difference in helping young companies translate fresh science into transformative societal gains. I hope you share the sense of purpose and opportunity.<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nWith high aspirations for the future — let's get started!<br />\\r\\n&nbsp;<br />\\r\\nSincerely,</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>L.

Rafael Reif announced the creation of The Engine, a new kind of enterprise designed to support startup companies working on scientific and technological innovation with the potential for transformative societal impact.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>President Reif made the announcement at an evening event at The Engine’s Central Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts, headquarters attended by entrepreneurs, business leaders, investors, and members of the MIT community.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine is designed to meet an underserved need. In Kendall Square and Greater Boston, many breakthrough innovations cannot effectively leave the lab because companies pursuing capital- and time-intensive technologies have difficulty finding stable support and access to the resources they need.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<div class=\\\"cms-placeholder-content-video\\\"></div>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“If we hope for serious solutions to the world’s great challenges, we need to make sure the innovators working on those problems see a realistic pathway to the marketplace,”&nbsp;President Reif says.&nbsp;“The Engine can provide that pathway by prioritizing breakthrough ideas over early profit, helping to shorten the time it takes these startups to become ‘VC-ready,’ providing comprehensive support in the meantime, and creating an enthusiastic community of inventors and supporters who share a focus on making a better world.&nbsp;We believe this approach can offer exponential growth to regions that pursue it successfully&nbsp;—&nbsp;and we want Greater Boston to lead the way.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To fuel The Engine, MIT will seek to attract hundreds of millions of dollars of support and to make available, for entrepreneurs, hundreds of thousands of square feet of space in Kendall Square and nearby communities.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine will also introduce startups to their entrepreneurial peers and to established companies, in innovation clusters across the region and around the world: It seeks to power a network of innovation networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“The Engine builds on work MIT has undertaken in recent years to stoke innovation on and near our campus —&nbsp;including starting up the MIT Innovation Initiative in 2014,” says MIT Provost Martin Schmidt. “Our faculty, alumni, and student entrepreneurs directly serve the Institute’s mission of using science and technology to make a better world, because the problems they pursue tend to be the hardest ones they can find.”&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine, whose launch has been led by MIT Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz, will offer startups “patient” capital; affordable workspaces; access to specialized equipment; streamlined business services; and a community of like-minded entrepreneurs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“We want highly disruptive entrepreneurs to stay in Greater Boston,” Ruiz says. “This is where the boldest ideas in the world should find their home.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>A startup as different as the startups it will serve</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine seeks eventually to support in steady state 60 locally based startups, primarily those that are developing “tough” technologies — breakthrough ideas that require time and patient capital to commercialize — in a range of sectors including biotechnology, robotics, manufacturing, medical devices, and energy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><br />\\r\\nAccepted startups will participate in The Engine’s incubator for up to 12 months. In that time, they will receive financial investments as well as guidance in business planning and access to shared services such as legal, technology licensing, and administrative assistance. Entrepreneurs will be able to take advantage of specialized equipment, services, expertise, and space through an online marketplace developed for The Engine.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To financially support startups, The Engine will form a venture-investing arm, which will provide significant, long-term capital support to help startups transition from ideation phases to commercial success. The Engine venture funds will demand less equity in startups than is typical, allowing founders to maintain more control over their companies. The Engine is also actively exploring avenues to support nonprofit startups.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To start, The Engine is raising $150 million for a first fund, with $25 million coming from MIT as a limited partner.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine will also provide space to participating startups. Its Cambridge headquarters will offer 26,000 square feet, and MIT seeks to make available in Kendall Square and nearby neighborhoods, as soon as possible, a first wave of additional space, so that participating companies could soon have over 200,000 square feet designed to meet their needs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As part of The Engine, MIT is starting a pilot program with the City of Cambridge — “Pathways to Invention” — designed to give Cambridge schoolchildren hands-on experiences, at MIT and around the city, that introduce them to the work of invention and to the college and career paths that lead to it.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Acceleration at two vital stages for startups </strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine will support entrepreneurs during two specific stages of innovation: the early “proof of product” stage, when entrepreneurs initially translate a novel idea into a commercializable venture, and the later stage between advanced prototypes and commercial production.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For the initial stage — which includes initial prototyping and product testing — The Engine will make meaningful investments that will allow participating startups to get off the ground quickly and operate long enough to prove their concepts’ viability. It will also provide shared access to costly infrastructure and resources and foster a community of experts and innovators who can lend expertise to the startups: Building upon lessons learned by the Innovation Initiative in supporting innovation and entrepreneurship on campus, MIT has identified many of the challenges that startups face as they enter these earliest stages.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For follow-up stages —&nbsp;after the startups have advanced prototypes but haven’t yet demonstrated their products at commercial scale — it intends to provide increased support to promising startups.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine will establish a network of existing and forthcoming shared spaces surrounding the MIT campus — including offices, labs, and prototyping and maker spaces — that will enable convenient and cost-efficient sharing of capital-intensive equipment, which is vital to startups aiming to make physical products.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Further linking the new facilities, Engine-sponsored transportation will help entrepreneurs and others move among facilities in Cambridge, Boston’s Seaport District, spaces in MIT’s West Campus, and other nearby areas featuring resources that will best serve the needs of entrepreneurs.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>A marketplace for specialized resources</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To make sharing space and resources easier, The Engine will create an online marketplace for entrepreneurs. A web-based application called the Engine Room will allow entrepreneurs to use or rent specialized resources from each other and from MIT, including office and conference spaces on and off campus, clean rooms, and other facilities and specialized equipment. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The application builds on MIT’s recently released Mobius App, which makes the Institute’s labs, makerspaces, and other resources more broadly available to students. The Engine will work with hosts to establish terms of access, instead of leaving negotiation to each startup. The Engine Room will also serve as a portal to a network of experts and mentors.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the long run, The Engine aims to link Cambridge, Boston, and other Massachusetts regions and cities as an interconnected network — and to link its activities to those of other centers of innovation across the world, such as MIT’s innovation activities in&nbsp;Hong Kong and Singapore.&nbsp;</p>\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/mit-announces-the-engine-for-entrepreneurs-1026\",\"id\":\"a/11\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/MIT-Engine-02.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/mit-announces-the-engine-for-entrepreneurs-1026\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-26T21:17:52.000Z\",\"summary\":\"The Engine will provide funding, space, and expertise — powering a network of innovation networks.\",\"title\":\"MIT launches new venture for world-changing entrepreneurs\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/11\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"<p>MIT researchers have been awarded a grant of nearly $1.3 million through the U.S. Department of Energy’s SunShot Initiative to study the reasons for solar energy’s rapid and sustained cost decline and how to continue reducing costs in the future.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The awarded project, which will examine features of photovoltaic (PV) devices, public policies, and private sector efforts, is titled “<a href=\\\"http://energy.gov/eere/sunshot/project-profile-massachusetts-institute-technology-seeds2-ses\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Modeling&nbsp;Photovoltaics Innovation and Deployment Dynamics</a>.” It will be led by principal investigator Jessika Trancik, associate professor in MIT's Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), along with co-principal investigators Tonio Buonassisi, associate professor in mechanical engineering; and David Hs, assistant professor in urban studies and planning — all of whom are also faculty affiliates of the MIT Energy Initiative — and Robert Margolis of the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Postdoc James McNerney and PhD student Goksin Kavlak, both of IDSS, are also involved.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To evaluate the mechanisms driving PV system cost reductions, the MIT team will delve deeply into specific past&nbsp;technological&nbsp;innovations and policies, and prospectively assess PV’s potential for future&nbsp;cost reduction. New datasets and modeling frameworks will provide a comprehensive picture of how specific technology and&nbsp;policy&nbsp;developments have led to the dramatic cost reduction in PV in recent decades.

In this second round of SEEDS funding, researchers will further develop this research method and model and apply it to all PV system components across different locations. The project will estimate how much device-level factors, such as larger silicon wafers, improved module efficiency, or better installation methods, and high-level drivers, such as scale economies or research and development, contributed to past reductions. One output of the project will be datasets&nbsp;that capture how PV systems’ costs declined historically and what the key&nbsp;determinants were — from advances in the laboratory to legislative innovations.

Of the 65 million refugee and internationally displaced people, many are children. Already suffering from upheaval and stress, these children deserve the right to continue their education, but how can this be accomplished?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Last fall, MIT launched <a href=\\\"http://solve.mit.edu/pillars/learn\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Solve: Learn</a>, one of four focus areas under the <a href=\\\"http://solve.mit.edu/\\\">MIT Solve</a> initiative that aims to help solve world challenges by bringing together leaders from the private, public, nonprofit, and academic sectors to partner, fund, and implement promising solutions. Through an open innovation online platform, the Learn challenge is designed to bubble up impactful and scalable solutions to improve learning outcomes and provide a quality education to refugee children around the world. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This summer, 62 applicants answered the call to improve refugees’ educational plight by posting their novel learning ideas to the <a href=\\\"http://solvecolab.mit.edu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Solve CoLab crowdsourcing platform</a>. And on Sept. 28, as part of <a href=\\\"https://hubweek.org/events/solve/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Solve at HUBweek</a>, three top solutions were selected from the six international semifinalists who presented their proposals to a room full of private, non-profit, and academic leaders, including many from MIT. This first wave of Solve: Learn finalists will receive support from Solve and its partners, with the goal of funding, piloting, and implementing their solutions, and presenting at the flagship Solve at MIT event, which will take place in spring 2017.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I came to the Solve: Learn session to learn more about the refugee education solutions being put forward,” said Christine LeViseur Mendonça, co-founder of <a href=\\\"http://humansonthemove.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Humans on the Move</a>. “I am excited to see the ones that moved forward. At Humans on the Move, we are looking for solutions that we can connect with our partners, and I appreciated that there was a solution that was selected that was already helping refugees as well one that was in idea phase. I will definitely be back in the spring, as well as encourage education solutions innovators that we meet to apply when the Solve CoLab platform reopens in October.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The preliminary round of judges for this <a href=\\\"http://solve.mit.edu/pillars/learn\\\">Solve: Learn</a> challenge included MIT Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) Esther and Harold E. Edgerton Career Development Professor Admir Masic, who serves as the Learn challenge leader; CEE professors Franz-Joseph Ulm and John Williams and CEE postdocs Sarah Safieddine and Francisco Martinez, who helped evaluate the proposals; Solve Executive Director Alexandra Amouyel; Rudayna Abdo from <a href=\\\"http://thaki.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Thaki</a>; Kavita Gupta from the <a href=\\\"http://schmidtfamilyfoundation.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Schmidt Family Foundation</a>; Hala Fadel from <a href=\\\"https://leap.vc/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Leap Ventures</a>; and MIT Media Lab research scientist Philipp Schmidt. <em>MIT Technology Review</em> editor-in-chief and publisher Jason Pontin served as emcee for the event.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>A personal investment</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This educational infrastructure challenge is very close to Masic’s heart, because he spent his early teens in a Croatian refugee camp during the Bosnian War of 1992.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“My early schooling was interrupted when I became a refugee,” he said, “and I was not allowed by Croatian law to access its public educational system. I literally stumbled upon a high school one day with my mother and only when we pleaded our case was I allowed to sit in back of some of the classes. This lucky break is a major reason I was able to ultimately advance my education and be here on MIT’s faculty.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>He added, “I look at current situation of global refugees and am compelled to take action. We need to go beyond obstacles and deliver the quality education that these millions of young and forcibly displaced people need.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Not surprising, many of the solutions presented involved incorporating technology and engineering solutions that may originally start in one country, but can quickly grow to global scale.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“We must imagine new models and modes of learning to reach those who do not have access to quality education, and for that we should use the talent, ingenuity, and experience of all who would like to participate. Which is why one of Solve’s core values is open innovation and that anyone — hopefully even refugees themselves — can participate on the Solve CoLab platform,” said Amouyel. “If we can provide willing learners with fundamental tools like critical reasoning and creative thinking, they can achieve their full potential, and contribute to change our world for the better.” She emphasized that we must understand this challenge in the context of the economic, cultural, and political barriers to a quality education.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The winning finalists that will go on to compete were: “A Blended-Learning Higher Education Model for Refugees,” submitted by Kiron Open Higher Education; “Team Up to Teach,” submitted by Problem Solvers Without Borders; and “Crowd-sourced Education Platform for Refugees Around the World,” submitted by Gail Anderson ’88.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Maintaining the course for college</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Kiron’s winning blended-learning solution involves providing two free years of online study before refugee students can transition to a traditional college or university. During the program’s online phase, students follow one of three curricula. Kiron has already established a partnership to provide this online training with <a href=\\\"https://www.edx.org/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">edX</a>, a non-profit, open source online global education course provider founded by MIT and Harvard.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Kiron’s first cohort of 1,500 refugee students is based in Germany with additional pilot programs underway or soon-to-be-introduced for another 1,500 youth refugees in France, Jordan, Turkey, and potentially Lebanon. Acacia Landfield, who presented the team’s proposal, explained that its solution involves a global network of volunteers and does not require school transcripts up front — a good thing, since many refugees flee their home countries quickly, often without much of anything, let alone proof of education.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Landfield said online courses are complemented with physical and direct online tutoring and offline services — translation support, a buddy program, a mentoring program, study hubs, and career services — provided through staff and a global network of volunteers. European partners include major corporations such as <a href=\\\"http://www.bmw.com/com/en/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">BMW</a>, <a href=\\\"https://eurasmus.com/en/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Eurasmus</a>, and high-level government supporters. Although the program currently supports only teenagers interested in higher education opportunities, the group’s plan is to scale the program eventually to include younger children.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Our team’s goal is to empower refugee students to lead self-sufficient lives,” said Landfield.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Embodying “mens et manus” (“mind and hand”)</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Gail Anderson ’88, an MIT aerospace engineer turned math teacher, proposed a crowd-based solution as an early submission to the effort. She said her experience working with refugees at a Yugoslavian camp in 1987 helping those escaping from Bulgaria and Romania inspired her to take action given the global refugee crisis today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Her proposal, titled “Crowd-sourced Education Platform for Refugees Around the World,” is to create an online portfolio for refugees so that their credentials, and the courses and they have taken — whether online or in a traditional educaional setting — can stay with them wherever they go. The online platform would also serve to pair them with remote instructors and mentors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“As a teacher myself, I want to help children grow, inspire curiosity, and build knowledge. I believe there are hundreds of volunteers worldwide who want to donate their time to share their knowledge or mentor a child online.” &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>She suggested recruiting technology talent, such as MIT students looking for summer projects, to code an open source online mobile learning management system that could eventually grow and scale within and across larger communities. Each student would then be able to connect with a remote mentor, who could guide them by providing feedback and validate learning ideas. She suggested students should also have the support to create and maintain an online lesson portfolio that could validate their personal accomplishments in school and documentation for what they have learned for a lifetime.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“The best part of creating an online portfolio is to give the student something they can be proud of,” said Anderson, “someone no one can take away from them. I believe we can start reaching them now one by one, and then leverage the power of crowdsourcing to reach millions. And with more and more volunteers, we can find those teachers who have different language translation skills to offer.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I understand Solve is designed to bring people together who have new ideas so we can learn from each other. By putting us all together in the same room to discuss design and implementation, and through the convening power of MIT to get the resources needed, we are more apt to come up with the best, most viable solutions.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Frontlines of lesson planning</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The “Team Up to Teach” proposal was presented by Kathryn Zaniboni from Problem Solvers without Borders. She quoted a UNICEF statistic that shows one in five refugees is a child who most often is educated by non-professionals volunteering in camps. Many volunteers have stepped forward to offer their time and talents to this vast, growing underserved population, but more needs to be done to improve quality.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I’m one of those volunteers who works now in a refugee camp in Bulgaria, and I struggle with this responsibility,” she said, adding she particularly struggles to prepare lesson plans for her students, especially given she is not trained as a teacher and doesn’t speak the local language. Further, she said, volunteers educating refugees in Bulgaria have little to no connection or coordination with peers in other countries such as Greece, Belgium, or Germany, further limiting the ability to share ideas, foster efficiencies, and globally scale successful initiatives. “Team Up to Teach” wants to prototype an online platform and bring volunteers in refugee camps as well as qualified teachers all around the world to share their best practices, educational content and lesson tips “virtually.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Right now, every time I have a class, I first go on the internet and look for things to teach my students,” Zaniboni explained. “Yet, I have so many friends and networks of teachers that say to me 'how can we help?' So an immediate practical application would be to bring in their expertise virtually. For example, we’re trying to develop more play-based learning, but camp space is limited, and we don’t have a lot of sports equipment available. A teacher online recommended I set up plastic cups and have young children develop their fine motor skills by throwing items into the cups using underhand and overhand techniques. I would never think of that myself.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>She added that ultimately, the strategy would be to develop and grow partnerships with the local schools, but this virtual “team up” approach represents a positive interim solution.</p>\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/improving-educational-opportunities-for-refugee-youth-around-the-world-1026\",\"id\":\"a/13\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/solve-learn-semifinalists-mit.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/improving-educational-opportunities-for-refugee-youth-around-the-world-1026\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-26T20:15:01.000Z\",\"summary\":\"Three proposals in MIT Solve&#039;s “Learn” pillar advance to finals.\",\"title\":\"Improving educational opportunities for refugee youth around the world\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/13\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"<p>Members of the <a href=\\\"http://www.facebook.com/mitpuppylab/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MIT Puppy Lab</a> brought their puppy love to the portico of Building 10 with unseasonably warm temperatures near 80 degrees Fahrenheit on Wednesday, Oct. 19.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Puppy Lab founder Stephanie Ku ’14, a graduate student in the Harvard-MIT Health Sciences and Technology program, says the dogs were an instant success when Puppy Lab launched in May: “The first day, we were in the Lobby 10 Green Room, as I call it, and the temperature rose by like 5 to 10 degrees because there were so many people,” Ku says. “That’s not ideal in one way because no one wants to be in a crowded environment — you can barely touch the dogs — but at the same time, it’s an awesome thing because it shows us that there is a high demand and people were really interested.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When Ku got her own dog, Wingnut, last year, she began to think about how students miss their dogs at home and find to be very helpful the MIT Libraries' <a href=\\\"https://mindhandheart.mit.edu/events/furry-first-fridays#calendar\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Furry First Fridays</a>, as well as therapy dogs brought in around finals. “MIT’s a hard place, and we all know that, but we all love it as well, and we just want to make sure that we support the students who are here, and the staff and faculty, because they also have stress,” Ku says.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I thought it might be nice to have dogs more consistently available and to try to reach out to the dog community that’s already at MIT instead of relying on external therapy dog organizations,” she explains.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Around the same time, the MIT <a href=\\\"https://mindhandheart.mit.edu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MindHandHeart Initiative</a> was seeking grant proposals for campus wellness activities, and Ku’s plan for the Puppy Lab was supported with a $1,000 award. “MindHandHeart has also provided moral support and any kind of support that I really need if I run into a problem with logistics or with publicity,” Ku says.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Ku worked with MIT librarian Ellen Finnie, who is an instructor with the therapy group <a href=\\\"http://www.therapydog.info/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Dog B.O.N.E.S.</a>, to get eight new dogs certified as therapy dogs for the spring launch. “She’s been really vital in that process,” Ku says. “So right now we’re kind of in parallel programs: The Furry First Fridays program still runs on the first Friday of the month, and Puppy Lab does its own weekly programs on Wednesdays.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Based on a survey she conducted, Ku says, “It seems like Puppy Lab is something a lot of people really wanted and really appreciate.

The most familiar example of this might be <a href=\\\"http://news.mit.edu/2010/explained-reg-analysis-0316\\\">linear regression</a>, which finds a line that approximates a distribution of data points. But fitting data to probability distributions, such as the familiar bell curve, is just as common.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If, however, a data set has just a few corrupted entries — say, outlandishly improbable measurements — standard data-fitting techniques can break down. This problem becomes much more acute with high-dimensional data, or data with many variables, which is ubiquitous in the digital age.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Since the early 1960s, it’s been known that there are algorithms for weeding corruptions out of high-dimensional data, but none of the algorithms proposed in the past 50 years are practical when the variable count gets above, say, 12.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>That’s about to change. Earlier this month, at the IEEE Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science, a team of researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, the University of Southern California, and the University of California at San Diego presented a new set of algorithms that can efficiently fit probability distributions to high-dimensional data.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Remarkably, at the same conference, researchers from Georgia Tech presented a very similar algorithm.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The pioneering work on “robust statistics,” or statistical methods that can tolerate corrupted data, was done by statisticians, but both new papers come from groups of computer scientists. That probably reflects a shift of attention within the field, toward the computational efficiency of model-fitting techniques.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“From the vantage point of theoretical computer science, it’s much more apparent how rare it is for a problem to be efficiently solvable,” says Ankur Moitra, the Rockwell International Career Development Assistant Professor of Mathematics at MIT and one of the leaders of the MIT-USC-UCSD project. “If you start off with some hypothetical thing — ‘Man, I wish I could do this. If I could, it would be robust’ — you’re going to have a bad time, because it will be inefficient. You should start off with the things that you know that you can efficiently do, and figure out how to piece them together to get robustness.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Resisting corruption</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>To understand the principle behind robust statistics, Moitra explains, consider the normal distribution — the bell curve, or in mathematical parlance, the one-dimensional Gaussian distribution. The one-dimensional Gaussian is completely described by two parameters: the mean, or average, value of the data, and the variance, which is a measure of how quickly the data spreads out around the mean.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If the data in a data set — say, people’s heights in a given population — is well-described by a Gaussian distribution, then the mean is just the arithmetic average. But suppose you have a data set consisting of height measurements of 100 women, and while most of them cluster around 64 inches — some a little higher, some a little lower — one of them, for some reason, is 1,000 inches. Taking the arithmetic average will peg a woman’s mean height at 6 feet 4 inches, not 5 feet 4 inches.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One way to avoid such a nonsensical result is to estimate the mean, not by taking the numerical average of the data, but by finding its median value. This would involve listing all the 100 measurements in order, from smallest to highest, and taking the 50th or 51st. An algorithm that uses the median to estimate the mean is thus more robust, meaning it’s less responsive to corrupted data, than one that uses the average.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The median is just an approximation of the mean, however, and the accuracy of the approximation decreases rapidly with more variables. Big-data analysis might require examining thousands or even millions of variables; in such cases, approximating the mean with the median would often yield unusable results.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Identifying outliers</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One way to weed corrupted data out of a high-dimensional data set is to take 2-D cross sections of the graph of the data and see whether they look like Gaussian distributions. If they don’t, you may have located a cluster of spurious data points, such as that 80-foot-tall woman, which can simply be excised.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The problem is that, with all previously known algorithms that adopted this approach, the number of cross sections required to find corrupted data was an exponential function of the number of dimensions. By contrast, Moitra and his coauthors — Gautam Kamath and Jerry Li, both MIT graduate students in electrical engineering and computer science; Ilias Diakonikolas and Alistair Stewart of USC; and Daniel Kane of USCD — found an algorithm whose running time increases with the number of data dimensions at a much more reasonable rate (or, polynomially, in computer science jargon).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Their algorithm relies on two insights. The first is what <a href=\\\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/algorithm-shrinks-big-data-0520\\\">metric</a> to use when measuring how far away a data set is from a range of distributions with approximately the same shape. That allows them to tell when they’ve winnowed out enough corrupted data to permit a good fit.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The other is how to identify the regions of data in which to begin taking cross sections. For that, the researchers rely on something called the kurtosis of a distribution, which measures the size of its tails, or the rate at which the concentration of data decreases far from the mean. Again, there are multiple ways to infer kurtosis from data samples, and selecting the right one is central to the algorithm’s efficiency.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The researchers’ approach works with Gaussian distributions, certain combinations of Gaussian distributions, another common distribution called the product distribution, and certain combinations of product distributions. Although they believe that their approach can be extended to other types of distributions, in ongoing work, their chief focus is on applying their techniques to real-world data.</p>\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/finding-patterns-corrupted-data-1026\",\"id\":\"a/15\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/MIT-High-Def-Learning.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/finding-patterns-corrupted-data-1026\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-26T04:00:01.000Z\",\"summary\":\"New model-fitting technique is efficient even for data sets with hundreds of variables.\",\"title\":\"Finding patterns in corrupted data\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/15\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"<p>Sade Nabahe’s time at MIT has been defined by engineering projects that help people around the globe with everyday problems. Even when seemingly straightforward ideas have proven tough to implement, she has stuck with them and remained committed to improving the quality of life for people living in poverty.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Originally drawn to MIT by an interest in prosthetics, as well as a general love for math and science, Nabahe is now a senior majoring in mechanical engineering. She has worked on projects for communities in Tanzania, India, Peru, and Lesotho, and has traveled to Peru to research, test, and implement several technologies that promote health and sustainability in local communities. She plans on finding a way to combine her engineering background and interest in global development to one day impact people’s lives through policy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While Nabahe’s approach has shifted during the last four years, her overall aim has stayed the same: “My overarching goal in life has been to, no matter what, help people.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>MIT ambassador</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nabahe, who is originally from Tucson, Arizona, fell in love with the fast-paced engineering culture at MIT when she attended the six-week Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (<a href=\\\"http://oeop.mit.edu/programs/mites\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MITES</a>) program as a senior in high school. “I guess I was always good at math and science in high school, but engineering never crossed my mind until coming [to MIT] and becoming more immersed in that environment,” she says.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Now an MIT Admissions student ambassador, Nabahe encourages students from underrepresented groups from across the country to apply to MIT, and helps run events such as the Weekend Immersion in Science and Engineering Program, to introduce high school students in the area to MIT. Nabahe is also the president of the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, a group she has been involved with ever since she started at MIT.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I was lucky enough to discover MIT and my passion for engineering through MITES. I want to show students how great it is here and that yes, you can truly find paradise,” she says.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>D-Lab</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Soon after arriving at MIT as an undergraduate, Nabahe found <a href=\\\"http://d-lab.mit.edu/\\\">D-Lab</a>. In her first D-Lab class, EC.722 (Prosthetics for the Developing World), she worked on building a shock-absorbing pylon for unilateral amputees.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>After her first class, Nabahe was hooked. The next year she took EC.701/11.025 (D-Lab: Development), which examines the development community's responses to global poverty and introduces students to the principles of participatory development. Students are divided into country teams to focus on challenges proposed by a community partner, and have the option of traveling to that location over the Institute’s Independent Activity Period to codesign and cocreate technology-based solutions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nabahe and her group used an initial visit to Rayampampa, Peru to work with the community there to identify local problems that could benefit from an engineered solution. Through conversations with community members, Nabahe and her group found a project that she would ultimately devote a great deal of time to. “We had seen lots of different pictures of kitchens and houses, and it was very common to see a lot of soot on the walls,” she says. The people they spoke to also complained about coughing, “so we figured that the stove was the issue to tackle,” she adds.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nabahe’s group focused on designing a stove that would fit within the cultural context of Rayampampa. A common, high-efficiency, portable stove is the rocket stove, which produces a hotter flame than some other stoves, while creating more carbon dioxide and less toxic carbon monoxide. But rocket stoves usually only have one burner. Nabahe’s team designed a rocket stove with the traditional three burner layout.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“While there are a lot of great products out there, and they are engineered to be very efficient, they sometimes fail in implementation because people don’t want to be limited to one burner. [With our three-burner design,] we had an advantage. We were really trying to respond to the community while reducing health hazards,” Nabahe says.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>A continued commitment</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the end of the semester, Nabahe and her classmate Johanna Greenspan-Johnson applied for a grant from the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program (UROP). With the help of their advisor, D-Lab instructor Pedro Reynolds-Cuellar, they continued building stoves throughout the following semester, testing how quickly and efficiently they could boil a large pot of water.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But back in Cambridge, Massachusetts, finding building materials that would be freely available in Rayampampa — clay from a mountainside for the structure, and ichu plant fiber for insulation — proved to be a major obstacle.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nabahe and Greenspan-Johnston switched from trying to build a stove structure to measuring carbon monoxide levels from their stove, using a fume hood in D-Lab’s Burn Lab. They also finalized the design of the stove, so that once they returned to Peru they could get to work as soon as they had access to the right type of clay.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“And so we had this idea that theoretically would work, but we wanted to go back to Peru and actually use the local materials again and see if the community would accept the design. It looked a lot different than what we originally had,” Nabahe says. She and Greenspan-Johnston received fellowships through the Priscilla King Gray Public Service Center, allowing them to return to Rayampampa for three weeks the following August joined by another MIT student, Jorlyn Le Garrec, who was funded through MISTI.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nabahe, Greenspan-Johnston, and Le Garrec built the stove right outside of the local school. “We wanted to teach the community how it was made, because they build these stoves every few years,” Nabahe says. “We left the stove that we made there, and left all the mold material so that they could replicate it.” Nabahe also taught safe cooking techniques that they had tested back at MIT — such as using covers to lower carbon monoxide emission.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Back at MIT, Nabahe used older iterations of the stove for coursework in 2.671 (Instrument and Measurement) to measure the amount of heat lost in a specific design and handed over the Peru stove project to a new D-Lab:Development team the following year.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Another class at the D-Lab led her to use spare motorcycle parts to build an ambulance stretcher attachment for motorcycles in Tanzania. The hope is that an easily maneuverable vehicle will be able to transport pregnant women and injured patients in rural areas to hospitals. Nabahe says that the biggest challenge has been designing a way to attach the stretcher to a variety of motorcycles, because each back wheel is different. She continued working on this project after the class finished, rode in the ambulance trailer in the MIT Moving Day Parade last May, and is applying for funding to test the motorcycle ambulance in Tanzania this January with three other MIT students.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This year, Nabahe is taking 2.729/EC.729 (D-Lab: Design for Scale) and is working on redesigning the manufacturing process for photovoltaic frames for a possible new solar plant in Lesotho. In 2.760 (Global Engineering), taught by Amos Winter, she is working with a team to design a quick, low-cost method for flash-chilling individual drinks that could be used in India or elsewhere. Nabahe also serves as a D-Lab tour guide.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“D-Lab always jokes around that they sometimes derail students’ plans or their future careers, because when you find D-Lab you get sucked in. Rather than derail my future plans, they helped me discover them: I just hadn’t found what I wanted to dedicate my life to, and now I have,” Nabahe says.</p>\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/student-profile-sade-nabahe-1026\",\"id\":\"a/16\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/MIT-Nabahe-Sade-A1.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/student-profile-sade-nabahe-1026\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-26T04:00:00.000Z\",\"summary\":\"When a plan to improve stoves in Peru met unexpected challenges, MIT senior Sade Nabahe rose to meet them.\",\"title\":\"Seeing solutions through, across continents\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/16\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"<p>The <a href=\\\"http://lemelson.mit.edu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Lemelson-MIT Program</a> has announced the 2016-2017 InvenTeams, 15 teams of high school students nationwide, each receiving up to $10,000 in grant funding to solve real-world problems through invention.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The InvenTeam initiative, now in its 14th year, inspires youth to invent utilizing hands-on, active learning strategies.

A neural net might, for instance, be trained to recognize certain objects in digital images or to infer the topics of texts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But neural nets are black boxes. After training, a network may be very good at classifying data, but even its creators will have no idea why. With visual data, it’s sometimes possible to automate experiments that determine <a href=\\\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/visual-scenes-object-recognition-0508\\\">which visual features</a> a neural net is responding to. But text-processing systems tend to be more opaque.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the Association for Computational Linguistics’ Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) will present a new way to train neural networks so that they provide not only predictions and classifications but rationales for their decisions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“In real-world applications, sometimes people really want to know why the model makes the predictions it does,” says Tao Lei, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the new paper. “One major reason that doctors don’t trust machine-learning methods is that there’s no evidence.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“It’s not only the medical domain,” adds Regina Barzilay, the Delta Electronics Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Lei’s thesis advisor. “It’s in any domain where the cost of making the wrong prediction is very high. You need to justify why you did it.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“There’s a broader aspect to this work, as well,” says Tommi Jaakkola, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the third coauthor on the paper. “You may not want to just verify that the model is making the prediction in the right way; you might also want to exert some influence in terms of the types of predictions that it should make. How does a layperson communicate with a complex model that’s trained with algorithms that they know nothing about? They might be able to tell you about the rationale for a particular prediction. In that sense it opens up a different way of communicating with the model.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Virtual brains</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Neural networks are so called because they mimic — approximately — the structure of the brain. They are composed of a large number of processing nodes that, like individual neurons, are capable of only very simple computations but are connected to each other in dense networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a process referred to as “deep learning,” training data is fed to a network’s input nodes, which modify it and feed it to other nodes, which modify it and feed it to still other nodes, and so on. The values stored in the network’s output nodes are then correlated with the classification category that the network is trying to learn — such as the objects in an image, or the topic of an essay.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Over the course of the network’s training, the operations performed by the individual nodes are continuously modified to yield consistently good results across the whole set of training examples. By the end of the process, the computer scientists who programmed the network often have no idea what the nodes’ settings are. Even if they do, it can be very hard to translate that low-level information back into an intelligible description of the system’s decision-making process.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the new paper, Lei, Barzilay, and Jaakkola specifically address neural nets trained on textual data. To enable interpretation of a neural net’s decisions, the CSAIL researchers divide the net into two modules. The first module extracts segments of text from the training data, and the segments are scored according to their length and their coherence: The shorter the segment, and the more of it that is drawn from strings of consecutive words, the higher its score.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The segments selected by the first module are then passed to the second module, which performs the prediction or classification task. The modules are trained together, and the goal of training is to maximize both the score of the extracted segments and the accuracy of prediction or classification.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the data sets on which the researchers tested their system is a group of reviews from a website where users evaluate different beers. The data set includes the raw text of the reviews and the corresponding ratings, using a five-star system, on each of three attributes: aroma, palate, and appearance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What makes the data attractive to natural-language-processing researchers is that it’s also been annotated by hand, to indicate which sentences in the reviews correspond to which scores. For example, a review might consist of eight or nine sentences, and the annotator might have highlighted those that refer to the beer’s “tan-colored head about half an inch thick,” “signature Guinness smells,” and “lack of carbonation.” Each sentence is correlated with a different attribute rating.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Validation</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As such, the data set provides an excellent test of the CSAIL researchers’ system. If the first module has extracted those three phrases, and the second module has correlated them with the correct ratings, then the system has identified the same basis for judgment that the human annotator did.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In experiments, the system’s agreement with the human annotations was 96 percent and 95 percent, respectively, for ratings of appearance and aroma, and 80 percent for the more nebulous concept of palate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the paper, the researchers also report testing their system on a database of free-form technical questions and answers, where the task is to determine whether a given question has been answered previously.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In unpublished work, they’ve applied it to thousands of pathology reports on breast biopsies, where it has learned to extract text explaining the bases for the pathologists’ diagnoses. They’re even using it to analyze mammograms, where the first module extracts sections of images rather than segments of text.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“There’s a lot of hype now — and rightly so — around deep learning, and specifically deep learning for natural-language processing,” says Byron Wallace, an assistant professor of computer and information science at Northeastern University. “But a big drawback for these models is that they’re often black boxes. Having a model that not only makes very accurate predictions but can also tell you why it’s making those predictions is a really important aim.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“As it happens, we have a paper that’s similar in spirit being presented at the same conference,” Wallace adds. “I didn’t know at the time that Regina was working on this, and I actually think hers is better. In our approach, during the training process, while someone is telling us, for example, that a movie review is very positive, we assume that they’ll mark a sentence that gives you the rationale. In this way we train the deep-learning model to extract these rationales. But they don’t make this assumption, so their model works without using direct annotations with rationales, which is a very nice property.”</p>\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/making-computers-explain-themselves-machine-learning-1028\",\"id\":\"a/30\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/MIT-Interpret-Neural-1.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/making-computers-explain-themselves-machine-learning-1028\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T03:59:59.000Z\",\"summary\":\"New training technique would reveal the basis for machine-learning systems’ decisions.\",\"title\":\"Making computers explain themselves\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/30\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"id\":\"a/31\",\"subscribeTo\":\"http://rss.nytimes.com/services/xml/rss/nyt/HomePage.xml\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/31\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five of their followers faced federal felony charges stemming from the six-week takeover in January.\",\"guid\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/bundy-brothers-acquitted-in-takeover-of-oregon-wildlife-refuge.html\",\"id\":\"a/32\",\"imageURL\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/29/us/28OREGON/29OREGON-moth.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/us/bundy-brothers-acquitted-in-takeover-of-oregon-wildlife-refuge.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T03:02:39.000Z\",\"summary\":\"Ammon and Ryan Bundy and five of their followers faced federal felony charges stemming from the six-week takeover in January.\",\"title\":\"Bundy Brothers Acquitted in Takeover of Oregon Wildlife Refuge\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/32\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"Fierce fighting broke out around the northern Syrian city of Aleppo Friday as rebels announced a large-scale offensive to break the government's nearly two-month siege of opposition-held areas.\",\"guid\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/28/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html\",\"id\":\"a/33\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2016/10/28/world/middleeast/ap-ml-syria.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T09:57:32.000Z\",\"summary\":\"Fierce fighting broke out around the northern Syrian city of Aleppo Friday as rebels announced a large-scale offensive to break the government's nearly two-month siege of opposition-held areas.\",\"title\":\"Syrian Rebels Launch Aleppo Offensive to Break Siege\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/33\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"Here’s what you need to know to start your day.\",\"guid\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/briefing/us-briefing-election-oregon-vine.html\",\"id\":\"a/34\",\"imageURL\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/29/world/28USBriefing-oregon1/28USBriefing-oregon1-moth.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/briefing/us-briefing-election-oregon-vine.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T09:45:35.000Z\",\"summary\":\"Here’s what you need to know to start your day.\",\"title\":\"U.S. Election, Oregon, Vine: Your Friday Briefing\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/34\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"Friday: Behind the curtain at a Broadway costume shop, Halloween activities and rat-related news.\",\"guid\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/nyregion/new-york-today-broadway-costume-shop-eric-winterling-halloween.html\",\"id\":\"a/35\",\"imageURL\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/28/nyregion/28NYTODAY2/28NYTODAY2-moth.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/nyregion/new-york-today-broadway-costume-shop-eric-winterling-halloween.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T12:25:24.000Z\",\"summary\":\"Friday: Behind the curtain at a Broadway costume shop, Halloween activities and rat-related news.\",\"title\":\"New York Today: New York Today: Treasures in a Costume Shop\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/35\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"description\":\"Friday: A gender barrier falls in big wave surfing, support for Donald J.

Eight rowers in the lightweight women’s rowing program are preparing a shell for launch. The number 39 is stenciled on the bow and its white oars feature a maroon T. “Take advantage of the crosswind in the powerhouse stretch before the Weeks Footbridge. At the curve toward the Eliot Bridge, as we close in on the finish line, it’ll get choppy,” says Thacker, a second-year student.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Weather conditions are unpleasant for the largest two-day regatta in the world. The day started in the mid-40's (Fahrenheit), and winds on the Charles River are blowing at 15 miles per hour, with gusts up to 30. White-capped waves fill the expanse of the river in front to the MIT boathouse. Head Coach Claire Martin-Doyle comes by to rally the group. In her 11th season at the helm of one of MIT’s four crew programs, the only Division I sport on campus, her team regularly ranks among the top 10 in the nation. A longtime rower, she waves an arm as she shouts over the din of the visiting teams converging on the boathouse: “You just got to row tough. Be on task, be on target, and go hard,” she says.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Start time is fast approaching. The young women in the Varsity 8 lineup look confident. Dawn and dusk practices and deep camaraderie have paid off. On the water, the team is a powerful force. The 39, in fact, will soon be one of two lightweight women’s boats to make program history. Bow 29, with a total of four rowers, all first-year students, will be the other.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>By mid-afternoon, the MIT boats are by the Boston University boathouse, which is the starting point of a 5-kilometer course that ends by the Eliot Bridge. Senior Prianca Tawde, the coxswain for 29, leads her “young boat” in a ritual collective fist bump. “You are ready for this,” she says to the crew on the verge of their first collegiate race on the Charles. “Row clean and row well.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Thacker’s voice raises to a shout as her rowers build to race pace and cross the start line to the official yell: “ROW!” Among the third-year students in the boat are Michelle Lauer, Annika Rollock, and Sylvia Sarnik. They share a singular focus. The crew is family, the boathouse a second home, and this race, for the next 18 minutes, is the only thing in the world.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Earlier in the day, the three chatted with Tawde about why the grueling training is worth it. At practice, they say, you leave everything on land and enter a different state of being. “It brings a clarity of mind. Out on the water, solutions come to me,” says Lauer. Indeed, they feel rowing can be transcendent. “I love when it’s nighttime, and the water is like glass, and you just feel like you are flying along effortlessly,” says Rollock. Sarnik jumps in: “It’s like the boat just moves on its own.” Tawde smiles, and quips, “For me it does.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Bow 39 is passing the Riverside Boat Club. “Stay calm and stay aggressive,” shouts Thacker. The crew is racing at 34 strokes per minute, led by seniors and co-captains Priya Veeraraghavan and Sharon Wu, who set a powerful rhythm from the stern. They are competing against eight boats, including crews from Boston University, Harvard University, and Princeton University. Sarnik, in the bow, is giving it her all. She wants to execute well, as the coach says, and meet her own potential. And it wouldn’t hurt, she thinks, to beat Princeton.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As bow 39 nears the Weeks Footbridge, the crowd erupts. Rachel Osmundsen and other members of the crew team not competing this afternoon had timed a run from the MIT boathouse so they would be on hand to cheer. They join relatives from the U.S. and Canada — grandmothers, parents, cousins, siblings — and channel goodwill and energy into a single phrase: “Go MIT!”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Just ahead flash the orange and black oars of the Princeton crew. Bow 39 is gaining steadily. Their strokes are strong and even. “There is a weird difference between being in synch and really being in synch,” Rollock says. They are really in synch now. At the final stretch, Thacker screams, “Get us across the finish line!” And the 39 pulls by Princeton, crossing the finish line at 18 minutes and 34 seconds. The Engineers place third, the highest ever finish for an eight-rower boat in the lightweight women’s division at the Head of the Charles in MIT history.

Student Support Services (S3) has well above 5,000 student visits each year.” He hopes the interactive sculpture will tangibly share that data with the community. “When a student visits Mental Health and Counseling, Student Support Services, the MIT Chapel, and other resources at MIT to seek support of any kind, the student can take a wooden marble from a bowl in the department’s waiting room, and deposit it in the installation. As marbles accumulate over time, the sculpture will provide a visible reminder of how common help-seeking behavior is, and students who are struggling may be inspired to reach out for help when they need it,” he told the crowd.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Berezin then introduced four students whose personal challenges, or concern for others, led them to seek help at MIT. Each student dropped a marble into the sculpture and shared their own story of reaching out to friends and the supportive services available at MIT. Each story described how asking for help led to growth — personally and academically.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Flora Liu, a senior in mechanical engineering, began by sharing: “I learned that rather than waiting for someone else to notice that I might need help that I need to treat myself like I am worth taking the time to get help.” Lorraine Wong, a major in brain and cognitive studies and women's and gender studies — who is also Berezin’s co-chair on the <a href=\\\"https://mindhandheart.mit.edu/increase-help-seeking-0\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MindHandHeart Help-Seeking Working Group</a> and head of special projects at <a href=\\\"http://activeminds.mit.edu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Active Minds at MIT</a> — shared that “Everyone can feel better by talking to someone, whether it’s a clinician, a friend, or any of the support resources we have on campus.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Juliana Kerrest, an MBA candidate in the MIT Sloan School of Management in a dual degree program with the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, told her story of struggling with depression and balancing a demanding course load. Juliana explained, “When I started to get sick, things changed and I began to fall behind in my academics. I spoke with the Disabilities Services Office, [Office for the Dean of Graduate Education], and MIT Medical, and I got advice on how to talk with my teachers. They helped me to express that I was committed to my schoolwork, but that I had something very serious going on. The resource professionals that I talked to helped me be able to attend the Kennedy School because I had so many advocates.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Kathy Dieppa, a senior in civil and environmental engineering who is also vice president of Active Minds at MIT, spoke last and shared what it was like to switch from the class of 2016 to 2017 after taking a semester off. “Taking a leave from MIT turned out to be the best decision I ever made. Coming back was scary, but I was careful. Since then, I’ve felt I had a responsibility to my peers to make sure they know about the resources here.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Berezin emphasized that each of the speakers displayed “exactly the kind of behavior that we as teachers, staff, and administrators should be proud of, model, and celebrate for our students.” Though seeking help may feel like a solitary action, it is one that connects the entire campus community. In addition to students, the crowd represented a cross-section of the community, including Chancellor Cynthia Barnhart; Senior Associate Dean of Student Support and Wellbeing David Randall; Office of Minority Education Director DiOnetta Jones Crayton; Assistant Dean of Graduate Support and Advising Jason McKnight; counselors from MH&amp;C; MIT Chaplains; and members of the Department of Facilities. Also in the crowd and eager to participate were various faculty members, about 200 students, and representatives from MIT Libraries, the Alumni Association, and the Department of Athletics Physical Education and Recreation (DAPER).</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Berezin then thanked the artisans who crafted the sculpture’s glass and wood elements at <a href=\\\"http://www.fiammaglass.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Fiamma Glass</a> in Waltham, Massachusetts, and <a href=\\\"http://www.mjfwoodworking.com/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Mark Ferioli Woodworking</a> in West Bridgewater, Massachusetts. Berezin also expressed his gratitude to his wife, Laurie Berezin, who helped design the sculpture; the MindHandHeart Initiative, which supported the project; and Campus Activities Complex Associate Director Mike Foley, who found space in W20 for the sculpture.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Less than a month since its launch, the sculpture in W20 has started to amass a ground coat of marbles. Glass bowls filled with marbles can now be found in MH&amp;C, S-cubed, the Office of the Chancellor, the Office for the Dean of Graduate Education, the MIT Chapel, the Division of Student Life, the Undergraduate Advising and Academic Programming Office, MIT Community Wellness, various MIT Libraries, the School of Architecture and Planning, School of Engineering, and a growing list of others. Departments or individual staff, faculty, and students interested in distributing marbles should contact <a href=\\\"mailto:berezin@mit.edu\\\">berezin@mit.edu</a>. The “Helping You, Helping Others” sculpture will remain beside the stairwell in W20 throughout 2016-2017, collecting marbles.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MindHandHeart Initiative’s Innovation Fund&nbsp;grants, like the one that supported “Helping You, Helping Others,” are currently available.

The team has retraced the moon’s dramatic response in the first hours following the massive impact, and identified the processes by which large, multi-ring basins can form in the aftermath of such events.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The findings, published today in two papers in the journal <em>Science</em>, may shed light on how giant impacts shaped the evolution of the moon, and even life on Earth, shortly after the planets formed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The team’s results pertain to the moon’s Orientale basin, an expansive, bull’s eye-shaped depression on the southwestern edge of the moon, just barely visible from Earth. The basin is surrounded by three concentric rings of rock, the largest one stretching 580 miles across — about three times as wide as the state of Massachusetts. Until now, it’s been unclear how such massive, multi-ring basins materialized.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Using data collected by NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory (GRAIL) mission, the researchers determined that the 3.8-billion-year-old basin was created by a huge impactor that punched an initial, transient crater into the lunar surface, measuring up to 285 miles in diameter — about as wide as the state of New York.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This impact, the researchers calculated, sent at least 816,000 cubic miles of pulverized lunar crust flying out from the impact site — an amount equivalent to 135 times the combined volume of the Great Lakes.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The ejected material, which the team modeled in computer simulations, rose up like a tidal wave, then crashed down to the lunar surface, creating giant faults through the entire crust and forming two concentric walls of rock on the surface, each rising several kilometers high. Most of the action, according to simulations, occurred over just a couple of hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>If such massive, violent impacts were pummeling the moon, they must have been doing the same, if not more, to the Earth, says Maria Zuber, vice president for research and the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics at MIT.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“What’s interesting is, this was during the time when the first life forms were starting to emerge on the Earth,” says Zuber, who is the principal investigator for GRAIL and lead author on one of the <em>Science </em>papers. “These very large impacts probably came in, sterilizing the surface, and goodness knows how many times nascent life may have started and stopped and had to start again. It’s just amazing how catastrophic these impacts were.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><img alt=\\\"\\\" src=\\\"/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/MIT-Moon-Mapping-595x430.gif\\\" style=\\\"width: 595px; height: 430px;\\\" /></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><span style=\\\"font-size:9px;\\\">Above is the most realistic animation of the Orientale crater collapse and ring formation. Colors denote temperature, from hot, red crustal material to cooler material, in blue. Over a little more than 2 hours, the animation shows the moon’s initially cool surface as it responds to a very large impact. Instantly, the energy from the collision heats up the material closest to the impact, and the crust surges more than 100 km above the lunar surface, before crashing back down. The pulverized material oscillates back and forth for 2 hours before settling into the pattern of the present-day basin. (Courtesy of the researchers. Animation has been sped up.)</span></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Flying low</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The team’s results are based on gravity field measurements taken by GRAIL’s twin spacecraft, which orbited the moon from January to mid-December in 2012. In the waning days of the mission, the GRAIL probes were programmed to fly over the Orientale basin, dropping their altitude to just 1.2 miles above the basin’s rings — even lower than the altitude at which commercial jets fly over the Earth. Flying so close to the ground, the probes were able to take measurements of the basin’s gravity field at high spatial resolution, providing scientists with a precise map of the moon’s interior mass distribution.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Zuber, who directed the mission and led the planning of the probes’ route, notes that the Orientale basin is the best-preserved large impact basin on the moon, having undergone very little transformation since it first formed. For this reason, the basin is considered a relatively pristine example of what the moon and the Earth experienced during a period in which the solar system was dominated by large, catastrophic impacts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“The interesting thing is, if you look up at the moon, you see all these craters, and Earth used to look like that — it went through a very similar bombardment history,” Zuber says. “In trying to reconstruct the extreme environmental conditions that existed during this period of time, we have a clearer window into the past through studying basins on the moon, because the record of those impacts isn’t preserved on the Earth.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Measured impact</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In one of two papers in <em>Science</em>, Zuber and her colleagues analyzed GRAIL’s gravity field measurements and were able to solve a key mystery, namely, the size and location of the basin’s transient crater, which is the initial depression created when an asteroid blasts material out from the lunar surface. In smaller impacts, the transient crater is largely preserved. But in very large collisions, the transient crater collapses due to loss of strength in the target crust, erasing any hint of the impactor’s size.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the case of the Orientale basin, many scientists had thought that one of its three rings might represent the transient crater. But the new measurements of the basin’s gravity field show that the transient crater may have been somewhere between the two inner rings, spanning around 200 to 300 miles across. From the size of the transient crater, the team estimated that the initial impact blasted away about 816,000 cubic miles of lunar crust. The gravity signal also showed that two huge faults exist beneath the basin’s two outer rings.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“One of the really exciting results in this paper is, the outer two basin rings correspond to massive faults,” Zuber says. “And we were able to detect that these faults appear to have penetrated entirely through the crust and into the mantle, which is quite something.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Making a bull’s-eye</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the second paper, led by Brandon Johnson, a former MIT postdoc in Zuber’s group and now an assistant professor at Brown University, the team created a computer simulation to reconstruct the first hours following the initial impact that created the Orientale basin. The team ran the simulation multiple times, with varying conditions, until the final basin and its concentric rings matched the observations made by GRAIL.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Based on these simulations, the team estimated that the basin was carved out by a 40-mile-wide object that collided with the moon at about 9 miles per second, or 32,400 miles per hour. The impact pulverized the underlying crust, and the propagation and subsequent unloading of the shockwave caused material to rise up, then crash back down, sloshing back and forth in a wave-like fashion for the next two hours. The material eventually settled back to the surface in the pattern of the basin’s two outermost rings, each rising several kilometers high. This entire process obliterated any trace of the initial crater.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The simulations showed that the basin’s innermost ring was formed by a different process. While smaller impacts can cause material in a crater to flow inward, forming a mound in the middle, Orientale’s central mound was so large that it was unstable. The material eventually collapsed, forming the basin’s innermost ring.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Ultimately, what this tells us is that the early history of the planets, at the time life was developing on Earth, was an extraordinarily hostile environment,” Zuber says. “There were extreme, energetic events that produced remarkably difficult environmental conditions. Maybe that’s why life is as tenacious as it is, because life forms somehow developed in the time subsequent to these catastrophic events. They were tough little buggers.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This research was supported by the NASA Discovery Program.

In creating the work, the artist first produced a wood model in her studio using 4x4-inch cedar beams milled for the construction industry.&nbsp; Using circular saws and a range of cutting tools, she sliced, marked, and shaped the wood elements, then stacked them to create layers that were glued and screwed into place. The full-scale wood model was then transported to Polich Tallix Fine Art Foundry (founded by Richard Polich SM ’65), where the majority of the sculpture was sand cast while the delicate filigree sections were cast using the lost-wax technique. Von Rydingsvard patinated the bronze surface by hand with chemicals and a blow torch.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>For over 30 years, von Rydingsvard has been making monumental sculptures that reveal the trace of the human hand and resemble objects and environments that echo the artist’s family heritage in pre-industrial Poland. The artist’s childhood was marked by the strain of living in eight different refugee camps over the course of five years. Her earliest recollections — of displacement and subsistence through humble means — infuse her work with emotional potency. Von Rydingsvard has built towering cedar structures, creating intricate networks of individual beams, shaped by sharp and lyrical cuts and fused together to form rich, dynamic surfaces. While abstract at its core, von Rydingsvard’s work takes visual cues from the landscape, the human body, and utilitarian objects — such as the artist’s collection of household vessels — and demonstrates an interest in the point where the human-made meets nature. &nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Ursula von Rydingsvard’s commissioned piece for the McGovern is a fantastic addition to MIT’s great public art collection,” <a href=\\\"https://listart.mit.edu\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">List Visual Arts Center</a> Director Paul C.

If things like roofing, insulation, and energy-efficient windows are among the first things that come to mind, you’re not wrong — but you also don’t have the complete picture. Unfortunately, decision-makers, including architects and builders, may not always have the full picture up front either.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While there have been promising advances in building methods and technologies designed to increase energy efficiency and lower the environmental impact of buildings, most building codes and energy efficiency standards address just the use phase of the building — this could inadvertently encourage manufacturing activities with higher long-term environmental impacts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Buildings are complex,” says MIT Professor Jeremy Gregory, executive director of the <a href=\\\"http://cshub.mit.edu/\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub</a> (CSHub). “To understand the full environmental impact of a structure over decades of use, all phases — starting before construction and continuing on to the very end of the structure’s life — must be considered.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A new report from the CSHub entitled “<a href=\\\"http://cshub.mit.edu/news/comparing-whole-building-building-product-environmental-performance\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">Critical Issues When Comparing Whole Building and Building Product Environmental Performance</a>” addresses important concepts in quantifying the environmental impact of buildings and the products that comprise them. The report also makes recommendations for current and future building practices using life cycle assessment (LCA) and offers suggestions for research to advance future study and practice in this area.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“One of the key takeaways is that there are many factors that must be considered before evaluating claims that one or another building type or product offers a better environmental return,” says Gregory, who is one of the authors of the new report. “Decision-makers must take a life-cycle perspective when evaluating impacts. One material may have a higher impact at the outset but result in a much lower impact across a structure’s lifespan.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Building sector guides, product category rules, and environmental product declarations that use LCA to evaluate environmental impacts, including guidelines set forth by the leadership in energy and environmental design (LEED) rating system, have certainly moved the industry forward. However, the prevailing methods have limitations; for example, they lack consistency in their approach, and they do not allow whole buildings or even building products to be compared against alternatives.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“The ability to compare one building type to another, or one product choice with another, is extremely important so that decision-makers fully understand the benefits or consequences of shifting building designs and technologies,” said Gregory.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This report, like past CSHub research (<a href=\\\"http://cshub.mit.edu/sites/default/files/documents/MIT%20Buildings%20LCA%20Report.pdf\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">including a 2011 Building LCA report</a>), advocates for the development of a standardized buildings LCA framework, which researchers feel is essential in order to increase the accuracy of the LCA approach. It also adds a call for comparability. The new research is part of ongoing work by the CSHub, which has undertaken a series of projects quantifying the full life cycle impacts of buildings. The team also published a revised <a href=\\\"http://cshub.mit.edu/news/revised-report-lca-residential-buildings-literature-review-gap-analysis\\\" target=\\\"_blank\\\">literature review and gap analysis on the topic</a> earlier this month.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“There is significant inconsistency in the way that many life-cycle assessment studies consider, or in some cases ignore, the life-cycle stages of buildings,”&nbsp;said Randy Kirchain, co-director of the CSHub and&nbsp;principal research scientist in the Materials Systems Laboratory. \\\"This report tries to highlight where inconsistencies often are found and identifies best practices to address those aspects of buildings LCA.”&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Kirchain added, “Work both here at the hub and by many other LCA experts has made it clear that without a full life-cycle assessment, the picture is incomplete.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>MIT Concrete Sustainability Hub research is supported by the Portland Cement Association and the Ready Mixed Concrete Research and Education Foundation.</p>\",\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/report-addresses-critical-issues-in-building-practices-1028\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T18:50:01.000Z\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/report-addresses-critical-issues-in-building-practices-1028\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/pracast-concrete-mit.JPG\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"id\":\"a/63\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/63\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"title\":\"Revving up The Engine for global change\",\"summary\":\"“At MIT, it is our duty to bring transformative innovation to the world,” President Reif said at launch event for new enterprise.\",\"description\":\"<p>At yesterday’s launch event for The Engine — MIT’s new enterprise that aims to support local startups working on transformative technologies — MIT President L.

Rafael Reif said, opening the event for a capacity crowd of entrepreneurs, business leaders, investors, and MIT community members gathered at The Engine’s new headquarters at 501 Massachusetts Avenue, in Cambridge, Massachusetts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><a href=\\\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/mit-announces-the-engine-for-entrepreneurs-1026\\\">Announced Wednesday</a>, The Engine is a startup accelerator and innovation hub that will support 60 locally based companies at any one time, with a focus on “tough” technologies — breakthrough ideas that require time to commercialize — in a range of sectors including biotechnology, robotics, manufacturing, medical devices, and energy.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“What truly sets The Engine apart,” Reif added, “is its emphasis on impact. In assessing candidate companies, it will prioritize breakthrough answers to big questions and to big problems, over early profits.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Reif penned an <a href=\\\"http://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2016/10/26/reif/o0I3OhgX8B1HYjYi04PzJL/story.html\\\">op-ed</a> in the <em>Boston Globe</em> discussing The Engine’s mission to solve the world’s most pressing challenges.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine’s support for entrepreneurs will include a “distinctive package of resources,” Reif said: “patient” capital, affordable local space, access to highly specialized equipment, streamlined business services, and expertise. The Engine will also connect entrepreneurs to MIT alumni, like-minded entrepreneurs, and major corporations in the region and beyond.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Engine seeks to raise $150 million for a first investment fund; MIT will invest $25 million in that fund as a limited partner. The Engine will also offer 26,000 square feet at its headquarters, with aims to make available to entrepreneurs more than 200,000 square feet in Kendall Square and nearby neighborhoods. The new initiative also includes The Engine Room, an online marketplace that will enable entrepreneurs to use or rent specialized resources from each other and from MIT, including office and conference spaces, clean rooms, and other facilities and equipment.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Reif and the event’s other speakers — including entrepreneurs, MIT professors, venture capitalists, and industry representatives —&nbsp;said The Engine promises to foster new collaborations between entrepreneurs and industry, create a more attractive regional innovation ecosystem, and promote venture capital investment in transformative technologies. The Engine’s primary goal, Reif said, is to help innovators tackle the world’s toughest challenges, such as climate change, clean energy, water and food issues, cancer, autism, Alzheimer’s disease, and infectious diseases.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Innovators are finding it very difficult to secure funding, space, equipment, expertise, and networks to fully develop their technologies. Many of them are working on solutions to humanity’s most pressing problems, so if they cannot get their ideas to market, society loses as well,” he said. “The Engine will help deliver important answers for addressing such intractable problems — answers that may otherwise never leave the lab.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In closing the event, MIT Executive Vice President and Treasurer Israel Ruiz, who led the launch of The Engine, said MIT will begin recruiting knowledgeable leadership, among other tasks, to get The Engine running efficiently by next spring. “We want to make sure that what we have is an engine that runs for the long run,” he said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Regional impact, global change</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a discussion moderated by MIT Media Lab Director Joi Ito, panelists discussed how the initiative could benefit their work and the region, and offered advice on fine-tuning The Engine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Venture capitalist Antonio Rodriguez, a general partner at Matrix Partners, said that giving startups resources to validate their transformative — and sometimes risky — technologies early on could encourage more venture capitalists to invest. Moreover, he added, The Engine could help keep startups in Boston.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Venture capitalist firms are like hammers seeking nails that sometimes aren’t there, Rodriguez said: “I think the thing an organization like this can do is make sure those nails are there to be hit … across industries that are going to solve these big, hard problems.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Jay Bradner, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, said Novartis could be a “powerful neighbor” for The Engine, noting some of Novartis’ previous collaborations with MIT in developing new therapeutics. Addressing MIT leadership, he said, “We really need to organize around how we plan to use this sandbox together.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Echoing Bradner’s sentiments about stronger collaboration was Sue Siegel, CEO of GE Ventures, who said her firm could find ways to potentially support The Engine’s startups with expertise, capital, and methods of distribution. “It’s a remarkable overlap in terms of the innovation possibilities that we can have with MIT and The Engine,” she said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Panelist Leslie Dewan ’06, PhD ’13, founder and CEO of MIT spinout Transatomic Power, which is developing an advanced reactor that generates clean and low-cost nuclear power, said The Engine could help bring related startups to Boston, where few are located. “One of the things I’m so excited about … is the prospect of having more peers,” she said. “Cambridge is uniquely positioned to be a hub of advanced nuclear reactor development.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>When asked what advice they’d offer to The Engine’s organizers, panelists suggested removing financial and legal barriers for entering the market, ensuring Boston becomes an attractive settling place for startups, and better utilizing existing MIT facilities for startups — “like MIT’s nuclear reactor,” Dewan remarked.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Institute Professor Phillip Sharp, co-founder of Biogen, which launched in Kendall Square in the 1970s, told MIT leadership to “take on the challenge of being the meeting place, of bringing the entrepreneurs, the venture capitalists, the students, the postdocs together in a form where you can talk about entrepreneurship, creativity, finance, all the other issues. That’s very hard to do on a campus. But it is something The Engine could use in creating the future.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Panelist Guru Banavar, vice president and chief science officer for cognitive computing at IBM, also spoke about the potential for collaboration between his company and The Engine.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Impact for startups</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Six startups founded by MIT students, alumni, and professors delivered brief presentations about their businesses, which could benefit from The Engine. They were: Raptor Maps, Spyce, Confer Health, Humon, Cambridge Mobile Telematics, and Transatomic Power.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Nikhil Vadhavkar, co-founder and CEO of Raptor Maps, told <em>MIT News</em> that The Engine’s value is bringing MIT’s “financial support and intellectual capital” to young startups. Raptor Maps did most of its research and development out of the co-founders’ dorm room. “So having a place like this would have been remarkable early on,” Vadhavkar said.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a video announcing The Engine Room, Natalya Brikner PhD ’15, co-founder and CEO of MIT spinout Accion Systems, which is developing molten-salt thrusters for satellites, praised the online marketplace, which they plan to use. “We’re excited to have a resource like this going forward,” she said. “Because as we grow our product line, we’re going to venture into new areas of R&amp;D. We’re only going to need more access to tools, and prototyping, and experts.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>David Garber, a first-year student in the MIT Sloan School of Management, hopes to launch a company based on a transformative technology, while in school. After the event, he told <em>MIT News</em> that the most exciting part of The Engine for him was the concept of patient capital. “It’s great to have investors and the Institute willing to take a risk on a technology that may not [yet] have a market [or] business viability, but could be something transformative,” he said.</p>\",\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/the-engine-global-change-launch-event-1028\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T18:30:00.000Z\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/the-engine-global-change-launch-event-1028\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/MIT-NewCo-Launch-1.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"id\":\"a/64\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/64\"}"," at position 0 for \"\""]},{"method":"appendChild","parent":8,"child":["div",{"$marginTop":"2em","$border":"1px solid gray"},"{\"title\":\"Susan Lindquist, pioneering biologist and former director of Whitehead Institute, dies at 67\",\"summary\":\"Biology professor and mentor to many investigated protein folding and its role in disease.\",\"description\":\"<p>MIT Professor Susan Lee Lindquist, a member and former director of the Whitehead Institute, and one of the nation’s most lauded scientists, yesterday succumbed to cancer at age 67. Her nearly 40-year career was defined by intellectually courageous, boundary-defying research and a passion for nurturing new generations of scientific talent.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Sue has meant so much to Whitehead as an institution of science, and as a community of scientists, and her passing leaves us diminished in so many ways,” reflects David C. Page, director of Whitehead Institute and a professor of biology at MIT. “She was a risk-taker and an innovator. She believed that if we were not reaching for things beyond our grasp, we were not doing our job as researchers; if we were not constantly striving for that which we could only imagine, we were not fulfilling our obligations to society as scientists.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A cornerstone of the Whitehead Institute community, a professor of biology at MIT, and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, Lindquist was a widely respected researcher with a global reputation for biomedical innovation. She made numerous, invaluable contributions to the study of protein folding, demonstrating that alternative protein conformations can have profound and unexpected influences. Lindquist’s research transformed budding yeast into a model organism for studying human disease, evolution, and biomaterials.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>She was best known for her work on prions — proteins that exhibit an unusual ability to exist in multiple stable structural states, with altered functions depending on the state. Using yeast, she and her colleagues demonstrated that prions have the capacity to drive change in an organism’s inherited characteristics without changing its DNA or RNA — relying instead on an ability to change how proteins fold. In a seminal breakthrough in evolutionary biology, her laboratory showed that prions can help activate many previously hidden (inactive) biophysical interactions, producing new traits that are passed on to subsequent generations. In other words, by uncovering (activating) previously hidden genetic variation that can help cells survive changes in their environment, prions provide a mechanism for the evolution of beneficial new traits.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In humans, devastating neurological illnesses such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Creutzfeldt-Jakob, and Huntington’s diseases involve proteins that change their conformation and thereby spur pathological processes. Among the many technical innovations created by her lab, Lindquist imported several of these disease-causing proteins into yeast, creating a platform with which to study disease-causing changes in protein folding in action and to test potential therapies for the ability to prevent the protein’s toxicity.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>A committed teacher and dedicated mentor to generations of biomedical and basic research scientists, Lindquist served as a professor at the University of Chicago for 23 years and then at MIT, where she had taught concurrent with her Whitehead Institute appointment since 2001. During her 15-year career at Whitehead alone, she supervised 115 fellows, graduate students, and undergraduates.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Inspired by Susan’s seminal work on the role of protein folding in evolutionary processes, I came to her laboratory at the Whitehead on a sabbatical from my role as a professor of pediatric oncology,” remembers Luke Whitesell, a senior research scientist in the Lindquist lab at Whitehead Institute. “Breaking traditional boundaries, we sought to learn whether some of the same basic mechanisms she had discovered in yeast might fuel the malignant progression of cancers and enable them to acquire drug resistance. The nurturing, extraordinarily cross-disciplinary research environment that she had created for her students and postdocs was captivating. Over a dozen years later, I am still here, privileged to have assisted her in training a new generation of physicians and scientists who share her conviction that deep biological insight is essential to improving the treatment of human diseases. We are all devastated by her loss, but determined to carry her vision forward.”&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Brooke Bevis, manager of the Lindquist lab, observes that, “Sue was the most creative, out-of-the-box scientific thinker I’ve known. She had a unique biological intuition — an instinct for the way things worked and the right questions to ask. And she was indefatigable, seeming to draw strength and stamina from the science itself.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>From 2001 to 2004, Lindquist served as director of Whitehead Institute — becoming one of the first women in the nation to lead a major independent research organization. In 2004, she resumed her research focus as an Institute member, an associate member of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, and an associate member of the David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT.&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Sue was a terrific scientist, colleague, and friend to many of us,” says Alan Grossman, the Praecis Professor of Biology and head of MIT’s Department of Biology. “She will be deeply missed at MIT and in the scientific community. Our thoughts and wishes go out to her family and loved ones.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Sue's bold strategies and unique ideas to understand neurodegenerative disease were recognized by her peers and supported by generous partners, including the JPB Foundation and the Belfer Family Foundation,” observes Li-Huei Tsai, professor of neuroscience and director of the Picower Institute for&nbsp;Learning and Memory at MIT. “She was a titan in the field and a genuine luminary, appreciated for her candor, friendship, thoughtful behavior, and superb communication skills. Her work and influence will continue to accelerate the fight against diseases such as Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s, as well as inspire and educate upcoming generations of scientific leaders.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“I met Sue when I arrived at the University of Chicago in 1980, and we’ve been close friends ever since. I was Sue’s maid of honor at her wedding; she introduced me to my husband,” recalls Elaine Fuchs, the Rebecca C. Lancefield Professor and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) Investigator at The Rockefeller University. “In Chicago, we taught together and shared our HHMI labs. Throughout these past 35 years, we’ve fueled each other’s science through many discussions and dinners together. I’ve never met another scientist as creative and visionary as Sue, nor a person so caring and loving. She was the gentle giant of science, and her work will continue to shape research and medicine — and inspire her family, friends, colleagues, students, and postdocs — long into the future.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An insightful leader with an incomparable perspective on the intersection of academic and commercial medical research, Lindquist served as an elected member of the Johnson &amp; Johnson Board of Directors since 2004, chairing its Science, Technology and Sustainability Committee and sitting on its Regulatory, Compliance and Government Affairs Committee. A biomedical entrepreneur in her own right, she co-founded FoldRx Pharmaceuticals and founded Yumanity Therapeutics and REVOLUTION Medicines.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Sue’s global reputation in biomedical innovation and entrepreneurial spirit, her courageous leadership and her commitment to teaching are an inspiration for all of us and for generations to come,” says Alex Gorsky, chairman and chief executive officer of Johnson &amp; Johnson. “With her keen perspectives, Sue’s made invaluable contributions to Johnson &amp; Johnson and consistently challenged us to deliver more innovation and enhance our commitment to scientific excellence and to patients worldwide.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Lindquist received many awards for her extraordinarily productive research, including the President’s National Medal of Science — the highest scientific honor bestowed by the United States — as well as the Dickson Prize in Medicine, the Otto-Warburg Prize, the Genetics Society of America Medal, the FASEB Excellence in Science Award, the Max Delbrück Medal, the Mendel Medal, the E.B. Wilson Medal, a Vallee Visiting Professorship, the Vanderbilt Prize for Women’s Excellence in Science and Mentorship, and the Albany Prize. She was elected as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the British Royal Society.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“Sue was not only a superb basic scientist, but also a committed leader,” says Erin O’Shea, president of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. “She served as a role model for women in science, including me.

recent years, the best-performing systems in artificial-intelligence research have come courtesy of neural networks, which look for patterns in training data that yield useful predictions or classifications. A neural net might, for instance, be trained to recognize certain objects in digital images or to infer the topics of texts.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>But neural nets are black boxes. After training, a network may be very good at classifying data, but even its creators will have no idea why. With visual data, it’s sometimes possible to automate experiments that determine <a href=\\\"http://news.mit.edu/2015/visual-scenes-object-recognition-0508\\\">which visual features</a> a neural net is responding to. But text-processing systems tend to be more opaque.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At the Association for Computational Linguistics’ Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) will present a new way to train neural networks so that they provide not only predictions and classifications but rationales for their decisions.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“In real-world applications, sometimes people really want to know why the model makes the predictions it does,” says Tao Lei, an MIT graduate student in electrical engineering and computer science and first author on the new paper. “One major reason that doctors don’t trust machine-learning methods is that there’s no evidence.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“It’s not only the medical domain,” adds Regina Barzilay, the Delta Electronics Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and Lei’s thesis advisor. “It’s in any domain where the cost of making the wrong prediction is very high. You need to justify why you did it.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“There’s a broader aspect to this work, as well,” says Tommi Jaakkola, an MIT professor of electrical engineering and computer science and the third coauthor on the paper. “You may not want to just verify that the model is making the prediction in the right way; you might also want to exert some influence in terms of the types of predictions that it should make. How does a layperson communicate with a complex model that’s trained with algorithms that they know nothing about? They might be able to tell you about the rationale for a particular prediction. In that sense it opens up a different way of communicating with the model.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Virtual brains</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Neural networks are so called because they mimic — approximately — the structure of the brain. They are composed of a large number of processing nodes that, like individual neurons, are capable of only very simple computations but are connected to each other in dense networks.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In a process referred to as “deep learning,” training data is fed to a network’s input nodes, which modify it and feed it to other nodes, which modify it and feed it to still other nodes, and so on. The values stored in the network’s output nodes are then correlated with the classification category that the network is trying to learn — such as the objects in an image, or the topic of an essay.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Over the course of the network’s training, the operations performed by the individual nodes are continuously modified to yield consistently good results across the whole set of training examples. By the end of the process, the computer scientists who programmed the network often have no idea what the nodes’ settings are. Even if they do, it can be very hard to translate that low-level information back into an intelligible description of the system’s decision-making process.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the new paper, Lei, Barzilay, and Jaakkola specifically address neural nets trained on textual data. To enable interpretation of a neural net’s decisions, the CSAIL researchers divide the net into two modules. The first module extracts segments of text from the training data, and the segments are scored according to their length and their coherence: The shorter the segment, and the more of it that is drawn from strings of consecutive words, the higher its score.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The segments selected by the first module are then passed to the second module, which performs the prediction or classification task. The modules are trained together, and the goal of training is to maximize both the score of the extracted segments and the accuracy of prediction or classification.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>One of the data sets on which the researchers tested their system is a group of reviews from a website where users evaluate different beers. The data set includes the raw text of the reviews and the corresponding ratings, using a five-star system, on each of three attributes: aroma, palate, and appearance.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>What makes the data attractive to natural-language-processing researchers is that it’s also been annotated by hand, to indicate which sentences in the reviews correspond to which scores. For example, a review might consist of eight or nine sentences, and the annotator might have highlighted those that refer to the beer’s “tan-colored head about half an inch thick,” “signature Guinness smells,” and “lack of carbonation.” Each sentence is correlated with a different attribute rating.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p><strong>Validation</strong></p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As such, the data set provides an excellent test of the CSAIL researchers’ system. If the first module has extracted those three phrases, and the second module has correlated them with the correct ratings, then the system has identified the same basis for judgment that the human annotator did.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In experiments, the system’s agreement with the human annotations was 96 percent and 95 percent, respectively, for ratings of appearance and aroma, and 80 percent for the more nebulous concept of palate.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In the paper, the researchers also report testing their system on a database of free-form technical questions and answers, where the task is to determine whether a given question has been answered previously.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>In unpublished work, they’ve applied it to thousands of pathology reports on breast biopsies, where it has learned to extract text explaining the bases for the pathologists’ diagnoses. They’re even using it to analyze mammograms, where the first module extracts sections of images rather than segments of text.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“There’s a lot of hype now — and rightly so — around deep learning, and specifically deep learning for natural-language processing,” says Byron Wallace, an assistant professor of computer and information science at Northeastern University. “But a big drawback for these models is that they’re often black boxes. Having a model that not only makes very accurate predictions but can also tell you why it’s making those predictions is a really important aim.”</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>“As it happens, we have a paper that’s similar in spirit being presented at the same conference,” Wallace adds. “I didn’t know at the time that Regina was working on this, and I actually think hers is better. In our approach, during the training process, while someone is telling us, for example, that a movie review is very positive, we assume that they’ll mark a sentence that gives you the rationale. In this way we train the deep-learning model to extract these rationales. But they don’t make this assumption, so their model works without using direct annotations with rationales, which is a very nice property.”</p>\",\"guid\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/making-computers-explain-themselves-machine-learning-1028\",\"id\":\"a/30\",\"imageURL\":\"http://news.mit.edu/sites/mit.edu.newsoffice/files/styles/article_cover_image_original/public/images/2016/MIT-Interpret-Neural-1.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://news.mit.edu/2016/making-computers-explain-themselves-machine-learning-1028\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T03:59:59.000Z\",\"summary\":\"New training technique would reveal the basis for machine-learning systems’ decisions.\",\"title\":\"Making computers explain themselves\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/30\"}"},{"method":"appendChild","parent":9,"child":" at position 1891 for \"aa\""},{"method":"setAttribute","object":12,"attribute":"$border","value":"1px solid gray"},{"method":"setAttribute","object":12,"attribute":"$marginTop","value":"2em"},{"method":"remove","object":13},{"method":"remove","object":14},{"method":"appendChild","parent":12,"child":"{\"description\":\"A jury found that the university defamed McQueary, a former assistant coach, after it became public that his testimony helped prosecutors charge Jerry Sandusky with child molestation.\",\"guid\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/sports/ncaafootball/mike-mcqueary-penn-state-verdict.html\",\"id\":\"a/53\",\"imageURL\":\"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/28/sports/28pennstate/28pennstate-moth.jpg\",\"isNewsItem\":true,\"link\":\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/28/sports/ncaafootball/mike-mcqueary-penn-state-verdict.html?partner=rss&emc=rss\",\"pubdate\":\"2016-10-28T03:14:40.000Z\",\"summary\":\"A jury found that the university defamed McQueary, a former assistant coach, after it became public that his testimony helped prosecutors charge Jerry Sandusky with child molestation.\",\"title\":\"Mike McQueary Is Awarded $7.3 Million in Penn State Defamation Case\",\"__url\":\"http://magrathea:8080/sandro/a/53\"}"},{"method":"appendChild","parent":12,"child":" at position 252 for \"aa\""},{"method":"setAttribute","object":15,"attribute":"$border","value":"1px solid gray"},{"method":"setAttribute","object":15,"attribute":"$marginTop","value":"2em"},{"method":"remove","object":16},{"method":"remove","object":17},{"method":"appendChild","parent":15,"child":"{\"description\":\"<p>The School of Engineering will welcome 13 new faculty members to its departments, institutes, labs, and centers during the 2016-17 academic year.
